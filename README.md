### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my STAT 386 assignments. I also need to get around to fixing the LEGO price scraping Streamlit app I created here, but that's for later.

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning git and basic data warehouse principles. Oneday I will be the Lord of the warehouses.

ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Star Wars and you'll be here for the rest of the day.

ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with creating android apps.
